%% Fit the NAOMi calcium model
% 
% Script that fits the NAOMi calcium model to simultaneously recorded
% spikes and fluorescence. The data used here was originally published in 
% (Chen et. al. 2013 Nature; Akerboom, Chen 2012 J. Neurosci). This script
% was in part adapted from a script written by Tsai-Wen Chen (2015/01/27)
% that called the data from the above publications. 
%
% Data available on CRCNS at: 
%    https://crcns.org/data-sets/methods/cai-1/?searchterm=chen%20gcamp
%
% From the original script:
% ------------------------------------------
% Ephys data were recorded at 10KHz
% Imaging data were recorded at 60Hz
%
% Each .mat data file contains a variable named 'obj'
% key recording traces and time base can be accessed by the following:
%
% traces = obj.timeSeriesArrayHash.value{id}.valueMatrix
% time   = obj.timeSeriesArrayHash.value{id}.time
%
% id=
% 
% 1: fmean_roi
% 2: fmean_neuropil
% 3: raw_ephys
% 4: filtered_ephys
% 5: detected_spikes
